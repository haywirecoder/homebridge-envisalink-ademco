# Change Log
All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file. This project uses [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/).
# v2.1.0 (2025-09-15) 
## Enhancements
*  Support for Homebridge 2.0
##### Warning: For Speedkey users - HomeKit's behavior with multiple services on a single accessory results in non-unique accessories names. This version will no longer group Speedkeys into one single accessory, rather it will create n unique switch for each Speedkey. This doesn't change the functionality of Speedkey, but pre-existing automation using Speedkey will have need to be re-created due to this change. This is a one time event going from 2.0x to 2.1.

 <b>WARNING:</b> When upgrading from any prior version of the plugin to version 2.0.0+, you need to re-assign accessories to rooms and rebuild/correct existing automation which included these accessories. This is a one-time event and is not a bug. This is the result of upgrading to the Homebridge modern dynamic platform, which generated new unique internal ID.
